# Mitch's Ceaser Cipher Machine

This is another of my early projects from my early days of learning programming. I have always had an interest in Cryptography, and wanted to practice that as well as learn some Ruby by writing this program.

In this first iteration, It is a functional Ceasar Cipher encryptor and Decryptor that runs in the command line.

The Ceasar Cipher is a very simple method of encryption that simply changes each letter a set amount of positions forward in the alphabet. Becase each letter is changed by the same amount, it is easy to decode manually. But this program can still do it for you and save some work. The key to the cipher is determined by any whole number.

In future iterations I would like to implement this onto a web page and add options for more complicated ciphers.
